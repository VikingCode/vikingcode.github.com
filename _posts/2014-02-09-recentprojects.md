This is a bit of a dump of the things I've been up to from December 2013 up until February 2014. I've been on a little bit of a turning "binge", I suppose. Woodturning is nice in that you can complete a project in a day, including finishing thanks to the ease and speed of friction polishes. This has been particularly important over the holiday season as I was tasked with making presents for a few people.

Apart from building my roubo workbench (which has taken a considerable amount of time to finish off!), the good weather has signalled many outside, gardening related tasks taking priority such as garden bed building, shed raising and shelving for said shed. Technically using fun tools, but not in a capacity I'm super keen to do and even less keen to show photos of!

###Pens
**Red mallee burl, sedona pen kit**  
Not the smoothest finish - first attempt at a CA finish, but without an accelerator it seems to be a bit streaky.
