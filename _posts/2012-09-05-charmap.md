> Dear CharMap.exe, 

> It is with a heavy heart that I write to you to inform you that you suck. Even in the latest and greatest edition of Windows, you're old. Look at the way you *aren't* able to resize yourself. You can't even display the full character set of *Segoe UI Symbol*.

> It is time to put you out of commission - your replacement is not just younger and more attractive, but has *features*. Resizable window? Check. Larger range of unicode character support? Check. Significantly larger characters? You betcha. Easier ways to copy into XAML? You know it.

> Sincerly, Everybody.

## YarrMap (Or *why you should stop using Character Map*)

CharMap.exe (CharacterMap) is *old*. I'm sure with each version of Windows there are some behind the scenes improvements to it, but ultimately it hasn't changed very much at all. 

While picking/viewing characters probably isn't the daily ritual of most users, typefaces are making a resurgance as a very important resource for developers and designers. In the last few years, CSS's `@font-face` has greatly increased the variety of fonts on the web and not just for text - pictographs/icon-fonts are rising in popularity for use in UI (that is, you can use an icon in place of an image). This isn't just happening on the web either, in Windows 8's Metro Apps, the "appbar" button icons are all from *Segoe UI Symbol*. Unicode in your XAML? Oh my.

To that end, YarrMap was created as the characters that CharMap.exe drops isn't fun, nor is trying to get a closer look.

###Features

![](images/postimages/YarrMap.png)

* Resizable Window (this should never be a headlining feature, but alas, I don't rule the world just yet)
* "Preview" view
* Larger character support than charmap.exe

I have a few things planned too,

* Preview text area with switches to enable/disable ligatures (and the different types of ligatures)
* Updater (waiting on [Shimmer](https://github.com/github/Shimmer))
* Export a complete character map (I have this working for IE10, but Chrome won't play ball with unicode)

Source is up on [GitHub](https://github.com/VikingCode/YarrMap), I'll add a precompiled version once I've got an updater system working.
