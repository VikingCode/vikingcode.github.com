title: My Windows 8 stuff
date: 2012-12-19
---

I've created a little bit of 'stuff' for Windows 8 (WinRT specifically), and it netted me an Asus Vivo Tab RT thanks to Microsoft Australia (more on that in another post).

Here is a short listing/explanation of all the projects I've created - and all of it is open source!
 
##Apps
I have *more* apps, but they're not released yet so I'm not particularly keen to talk about them, lest I stop dev. Most of them are on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/vikingcode/) though.  To get the VivoTab RT (mentioned above), I needed four apps in store by release of Windows 8. I somewhat burnt myself out getting the four completed/submitted/certified, so unfortunately I haven't released a slew of feature updates just yet.

###MarkPad

To follow up on Code52's MarkPad for the desktop, [MarkPad for Windows 8](http://code52.org/MarkPadRT) has all the basics of a well designed markdown editor. In the next version, I'm hoping to add GitHub support so that you can post directly to gh-pages (aka Jekyll blogs like this one)!  

Free, released under the MS-PL in all available markets, for x86, x64 and ARM.

###Smuggle

My choice of photohosting service these days is [SmugMug](http://www.smugmug.com/), but after their rather *lacking* WP7 app, I decided to make my own. This is the first of my projects to receive an update since launch - well, hopefully. The update is currently being processed by Microsoft now.

Unfortunately the store version has a couple of nasty bugs that weren't showing up on my account (which have been squashed), which has resulted in some poor ratings/reviews.

You guessed it, free, released under the MS-PL in all available markets, for x86, x64 and ARM, but it *does* require a SmugMug account (which is not free)

###ExXAMLate!
![](http://vikingco.de/exXAMLate/img/tablet_3.png)

Before the SDK update, people were submitting apps with no store logo, or bad contrast, or just missing stupid metadata things. Additionally, there wasn't an easy way to see all the appbar buttons. ExXAMLate is a small suite of WinRT tools to help make WinRT apps.

###YarrMap

##Libraries

###HtmlToBlock
This is still very much a work in progress, but it turns out if you want to do any sort of work with HTML, just create a WinJS app. Why? WebView sucks on so many different levels, it isn't funny. The alternative is - if you're dealing with basic HTML - to turn your Html into Xaml elements and put it inside a RichTextBlock. It's faster, scales better, and gives far more control but best of all, it renders with the correct Z-Index (WebView is "always on top") and doesn't steal focus on change!

###ColourPicker
WinRT doesn't feature a colour picker, and although its rare for you to need one, it is nice to have the option. This was based of Jose Fajardo's code, which wouldn't pass store certification, so most of it was gutted, and turned into a redistributable package.

##Templates
###Okra Project Templates
Okra is my Mvvm-ish framework of choice for WinRT. It isn't a 'pure' Mvvm only implementation, and includes a lot of platform specific helpers. The default app templates were (and still are) rubbish, including a lot of bad or unnecessary code. I cleaned them up, setup Okra and a few other libraries and packaged them up into a template. Now when I create a new project, `File -> New -> Okra Template` saves me a *lot* of time.

###Website Templates
If you looked at any of the project sites for my apps, you'll notice they all look vaguely similar. I'm a *big* fan of Jekyll/GH-Pages, and host all the project sites there. I created an (easyish) template to use to generate the skeleton for the sites.

##Utilities
###Sigurd
In the first update for the Window Store SDK, Visual Studio can now visualise and easily add all the various DPI scaled images for logos and tiles. The problem is it is somewhat of a pain to create all of those yourself. While it *does* give you the opportunity to customise the pixels for each version, for the most part most people are just going to be resizing their image to the correct sizes.

Drop the *largest* image for each type onto Sigurd, hit generate, and all the smaller sizes will be generated.

###HAMMER.PANTS
Unlike WPF, WinRT does not have the concept of 'DynamicResource'. At compile time, every resource must be present and accounted for. This can cause issues if you don't want to use the default colour scheme (purple) because the controls are compiled to BAML before your app. You need to reimplement the styles for the controls, which is a nightmare if you wanted to use red instead of purple.

Hammer.Pants takes the default XAML, a colour from you, and generates awesomeness.

It turns out it isn't just *one* purple, but a bunch of variations on the hue. I ran some hue detection code over all purples, determined what the variance in brightness was and created relative values. When you punch in your colour, it'll apply the same transformation so that it looks 'right', rather than just a single solid colour throughout.

Usage

	HAMMER.Pants.exe /colour=value [/inputfile=value] [/outputfile=value]

 	/colour hex (without the #) value for the "base" - only supports RGB values currently
 	/inputfile (optional - if on Windows 8 it will look in the "Windows Kits" directory for the necessary file)
 	/outputfile (optional - if not specified it will be named generic.xaml in the same directory as the Hammer.Pants.exe)
