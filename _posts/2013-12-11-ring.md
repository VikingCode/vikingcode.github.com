Last weekend [The Woodsmith](http://www.thewoodsmith.com.au/thewoodsmith/) had an open (two) days. Being normally a mail order business this was a rare-ish chance to get a look at their stock on sale. They also had a scraps bin priced at $1/kg. The wife and I picked up exactly 2kg, according to the salesguy.

This ring was crafted out of a piece of Rosita, an offcut from that sale. This is just one technique on how to make rings. Another technique is to carve the hole on the lathe itself, before parting it off - a little more wasteful but can have better results. I may give this a shot sometime soon to experiment with other types of finishes such as CA glue.
