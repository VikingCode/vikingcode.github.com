I've been looking at the [Scheppach](http://www.machineryhouse.com.au/W874) version of this saw for about 10 months now, originally considering it instead of a tablesaw while I built larger pieces of furniture. In the end, I bought a table saw as it was more versatile, but there are still some things a plunge saw excels at such as handling large sheet goods where it is easier to take the machine to the workpeice than the other way around.

The saw itself is identical to the Scheppach CS-55, Woodstar Divar 55 and Grizzly T10687 in every way except colour and logos. All come with Scheppach blades, although the Grizzly ships with a 48 tooth version instead of the 24 tooth the rest have. 

There are some variations to the "package"/kits, however. The other three brands come with a single solid 1400mm track compared to the two 700mm tracks and joiner, as well as clamps and stops which the Taurus/Aldi saw does not. Grizzly doesn't have the weaker/wimpier versions of the clamps in their kit, which are another $40 or so for the Scheppach. While the Taurus kit doesn't come with the clamps, they're probably not a bad idea to pickup at some stage. Apparently Scheppach Australia will be selling them for the Taurus saw, or Machinery House [have the clamps and stop available right now](http://www.machineryhouse.com.au/W8775)

At $179AUD, the Taurus saw pack is actually cheaper than *just* the Grizzly saw (no track) and that's in the US! (Australia tax is pretty high for tools)

Personally I think this is an amazing bargain and I'm glad I picked it up. It isn't perfect, and [Cosmas Baurer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqqcmC5UY5E) produced a video showing how he improved it (shortened spring, moved grippy-strip-locations), which I'm sure I'll get around to doing shortly.
