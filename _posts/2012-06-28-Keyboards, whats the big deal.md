> **TL;DR version**: Mechanical keyboards are good, but they're not the saviour rabid fanboys want you to believe they are. Yes they are great for *some* people, but not for all. There are plenty of reasons other than cost to go for a membrane keyboard but that varies from person to person.     
> Given the increase in mechanical keyboards available over the last few years, in five years time those reasons against mechanical keyboards should decrease.  
> Mechanical keyboard enthusiasts are to the keyboarding industry what audiophiles are to the audio industry. They're the people who buy the expensive equipment then *pester the heck out of anybody using anything else but "enthusiast" grade gear*.  

**If you're considering a mechanical keyboard but want more information, [Overclock.net](http://www.overclock.net/t/491752/mechanical-keyboard-guide) has the most definitive guide on individual components**

I have a mechanical switched keyboard - the [Corsair K60](http://www.corsair.com/vengeance-k60-performance-fps-mechanical-gaming-keyboard.html)[^1] - and I like it. I want my wife to switch (pun not intended) because *I* enjoy typing on my keyboard, but I know that she *shouldn't* change. It seems contradictory, doesn't it, that any fanboy would recommend against the system/device that he uses and enjoys?

Why shouldn't my wife use a mechanical keyboard? Because there is *none* on the market that meets her needs. Currently she uses the gigantic [Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/natural-ergonomic-desktop-7000/WTA-00001), a **wireless**, **ergonomic shaped**, rubber dome keyboard. Emphasis is used to highlight the "issue" with mechanical keyboards. There simply isn't any easily available ergonomic *or* wireless (let alone and!) mechanical keyboards. 

Looking at ergonomic shape first, [Truly Ergonomic](http://www.trulyergonomic.com) produces one keyboard (one keyboard, 4 variations which come mostly down to the labels on keys) that goes for *USD229*, plus shipping, and has been on back order for most of this year. I've found few ergonomic keyboards, and even fewer of those are mechanical, but the *Truly Ergonomic* keyboard is sadly the *lowest priced*. USD229 is a significant amount of money to "blind spend" - there is no way to test in a store or by comparing other products to see if you like [their unique layout](https://secure.trulyergonomic.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=20_26).

What about wireless? While the argument against wireless (usually) is battery power, with so many consoles and remotes in the house, we invested in a [quality battery charger](http://protog.com.au/maha-powerex-mhc801d-cell-aaaaa-battery-charger-p-30.html) years ago. While every other membrane keyboard these days is wireless, I could only find two wireless mechanical, the [XArmor U9W](http://www.amazon.com/XArmor-U9W-wireless-mechanical-keyboard/dp/B004S862FW) and the KBTalKing Pro (bluetooth), and neither available directly in Australia, with prices ~$50-100 higher than other mechanical boards *before* shipping. It boggles the mind that you can get a membrane wireless keyboard for as low as [$25](http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=113_257&products_id=18547), but will pay huge premiums for it if it is in a mechanical keyboard.

##So why are they gaining popularity?

###Gaming
It is easiest to demonstrate common advantages of (most, but not all!) mechanical keyboards if you play games. Membrane keyboards typically[^3] let you press two keys (plus 'modifier' keys such as shift, alt, ctrl) at any one time. This is known as "Two-Key-Rollover", or 2KRO. *Most* mechanical keyboards will give you a "KRO" of 6 or *more*. My keyboard allows 20 keys to be pressed at once, and many other mechanical keyboards give *N*KRO (or all keys at once) if they're over PS/2 (instead of USB). 

Why is 20KRO (or more) important? Well, it probably isn't. 6KRO is great and a big step up from what many membrane boards allow. 2KRO can easily be a limitation, one which I ran into using my previous keyboard (and confirmed that the Natural Ergonomic 7000 suffers from this too) - by playing a game like Battlefield 3, I could press W+A/D (forward + strafe) but *not* the key I use for push-to-talk voice chat at the same time (~). End of the world? Certainly not, but it was frustrating when I had to *stop* moving to be able to talk. 

###Typing
By only requiring half the actual distance travelled to actuate, gains in typing speed as well as the feedback/springback over membrane are noticable. Many touch typists prefered the IBM Model-M keyboards which had buckling spring keys. *Personally* I do prefer typing on my mechanical keyboard, typing on a membrane board now feels "squishy" rather than "accurate".

###Nostalgia
While this obviously applies to older generations (25+), many people are nostalgic for "early days" of computing which did often involve buckling or alps switched keyboards. 

###Should I get a mechanical keyboard?
Yes, no and maybe.

* ***If you want a wireless keyboard***, it's probably best to get a membrane or scissor keyboard unless you're happy to pay significantly more and import the keyboard yourself
* ***If you want an ergonomic keyboard***, you've probably come to terms with the fact that you're going to pay more for an ergonomic setup. Ergonomic membrane keyboards can be had for $50 (Microsoft's Natural Ergonomic 4000), but range upwards of $300 (Kinesis), which puts mechanical ergonomic keyboards about on par, but you'd be "blind buying" unless you know somebody else who has one. I'm not doubting products like *TrulyErgonomic 209*, but I'm not willing to part with that much money without trying it out first
* ***If you want every advantage you possibly can get in games***, yes, you should. 

What if you don't care about games, wireless or ergonomic shapes? Then it depends on how much you are prepaired to pay. 

###Alright, what should I get?
The majority of people who get mechanical keyboards are people who are capable of touch typing. If you're a "peck"-typist, its unlikely that you'll notice too much of a difference between different key types (physical motion of peck typist is significantly different and may not nessicarily have the control to notice 2mm difference in accuation). 

While some....[strongly opinionated, well known bloggers](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/10/the-keyboard-cult.html) would suggest that you should strongly focus on anything but pad-printed (see the primer if you're not certain what this is), but it really is a personal preference. If all your gadgets must look exactly the same as the day you bought them, nothing but injection molded will do, but if you're willing to accept that the labels on your keys (that you don't look at anyway because you're a touch typist) will fade with usage, any type of key label is fine.

Which keyboard should you get? I can't answer that. There are just too many factors to rule any one particular keyboard the "one-size-fits-all". I chose the Corsair K60 for a few reasons

* Relatively well priced ($135 is on the low end of mechanical keyboards),
* Clean design (minimial case with *no* backlight keys - to me thats a *feature*)
* I wanted "silent" switches, which left me with red, brown or clears (impossible to get)
* I wanted dedicated (not Fn+F5, etc) media keys

There isn't actually much competition to the K60 - the only other keyboards I could find with dedicated media keys ([Tt eSPORTS Meka G Unit](http://usa.ttesports.com/products/product.aspx?s=23)) has macro keys (which I've never used on keyboards with them) and a design I wasn't too keen on.

If you want the cheapest option, [CoolerMaster QuickFire Rapid](http://www.coolermaster-usa.com/product.php?product_id=3060) is relatively well respected (in terms of construction and features) and goes for $95-100, depending on which switch you choose (Blue/Black are cheaper than Red). The QuickFire Pro is a *full* keyboard whereas the Rapid is "TKL", and bumps the price to $105-109.

If backlit keys are your vice, Ducky DK9008 range has 13 (possibly more) different models - blue, red, green or white LEDs, with blue, black, red or brown Cherry MX switches.

##The future of mechanical keyboards
It would be folly to try and predict specifics, but this is what I'm imagining will take place over the course of the next 5 years. 

* Average price for mechanical keyboards will fall to under $100AUD, but still above $50AUD. 
* Logitech will enter the mech keyboard market with a range of gaming keyboards - a G15 (or is that G19, or G510?) successor (that is, keyboard with a LCD and macro keys) and probably one entry without the LCD. While they'll be late to the party, they'll bring some feature people "must" have, or at least drive prices down further. The design will resemble their existing keyboards, as frankly thats what Logitech loyalists want. 
* There will probably be a few new entries using the Cherry *ML* switches - they're "low profile" mechanical switches, like laptop keyboards. They're likely to become the most popular, if they're priced right.

What about Microsoft? Well, they've resurrected and killed the Sidewinder brand enough times that I can't really see them committing to building substantial products.

## Keyboard Primer
### Switches

There are several common (relatively) types of keyboard *switches* - membrane or rubber dome, scissor and "mechanical" (which we'll get to later).

* Membrane "switched" keyboards are the most common type because they're cheap to produce. 

* Scissor switches are more common in laptops, but some desktop keyboards like Apple's current range use them. The appeal is that they are more tactile than rubber dome and they can be created significantly thinner than a "regular" key, but they are more expensive. Scissor switches actually use a rubber dome/membrane as well, but the "scissor mechanism" gives stability needed with such low profile keys.

* Mechanical switches are an older type of switch, giving the best tactile response and the focus of this article. While there are a few different types of mechanical switches, readily available boards really only come in a variety of Cherry MX switches - buckling, Alps and Topre are either too expensive or too rare. Cherry MX has a large variety of switch types - linear vs tactile, silent[^2] vs "clicky", and "actuation" weights - ranging from 45g (brown/red) up to 80g (grey). The common types found are red, black, blue and brown, but clear, green, grey, dark grey, orange and white do exist - some in point of sale systems, etc.

### Key printing methods
This is not exclusive to mechanical keyboards, but the latter tend to be mechanical only (as they're already expensive, lets just add extra expense!). Keys can have the labels put on them in four different ways

* Pad printing, similar to stickers, wears quickest but is cheapest to produce.
* Laser etched, may not be as clear, nor as cheap, but it is permanent.
* Dye sublimiated, dye set inside of the keycap plastic
* Injection molded, two pieces of plastic mounted one over the other to form the perfect - and most expensive - key.

While they're ordered from "worst to best", it doesn't really matter unless you insist that everything you own looks *exactly* the same as the day you bought it. Pad printing will wear out, yes, by the time that happens you've hopefully learnt how to touch type so it isn't as important!

### Ergonomics
In the realm of keyboards, ergonomics aren't popular. That doesn't mean they're not *important* just in todays world, most people don't care and that largely comes down to cost. Ergonomic *anything* costs a lot of money. Good ergonomic chairs *start* at $500 and go for many times that, yet most people are happy to head down to OfficeWorks and pickup a $99 cheapy.

Keyboard ergonomics can be effected by three major attributes

* switches (specifically energy spent actuating keys)
* board shape
* board angle

I'm *not* going to talk about the differences between DVORAK, QWERTY/QWERTZ, Colmak, etc, as for all intents and pursposes QWERTY has "won".

Mechanical switches, in theory, allow you to use the least amount of energy as you have the smallest amount of travel and consistent (over the longer lifespan of a mechanical switch) pressure required (membrane keyboards as they get worn out require more and more force).

Board angle refers to what degree your hands are sloping "up" to type. Generally you want as flat as possible to reduce wrist strain. Elevated keyboards (even if flat) are also going to cause typing fatigue.

Board shape is probably the most debated, as even in the ergonomic circles there doesn't seem to be one specific agreed shape that beats all the others. Although specifically slanted towards Truly Ergonomics products, they have produced an image which sums this up nicely:

![](/images/postimages/Staggered_ergonomic_keyboards.jpg) 
![](/images/postimages/Symmetrical_Ergonomic_Keyboard_symmetric.jpg)

**It's important to realise that majority of the people blabbering about how mechanical keyboards are the be all and end all of keyboard ergonomics use the least ergonomic board shape.** As infallible as I am, even I'd classify myself as a beginner in the arts of ergonomics.

###"TKL" (TenKeyLess)
"TKL" or "TenkeyLess" keyboards are a more compact keyboard than the standard 104/105 key layout, but they're not squished together like "compact" classified keyboards. Confused yet? TKL simply drops the numberpad (which incidently has *more than ten keys*)

The argument "for" TKL keyboards is that most people don't use the numberpad these days (I certainly don't use much more than the enter key there), and the reduced width means that you've got less travel to your mouse (if you're right handed), thus further reducing fatigue and increasing speed switching between mouse and keyboard.

[^1]: I realise the K60 is a hybrid mechanical/dome keyboard, where some keys (to save cost) aren't mechanical. In [this diagram](http://www.corsair.com/media/FAQ/cherry_red_locations.jpg) the keys circled in red are mechanical, the rest are rubber dome.  
[^2]: silent is a relative term for mechanical keyboards - they're all louder than membrane.  
[^3]: There are exceptions to this, including Microsofts Sidewinder keyboards which have a 14KRO.
