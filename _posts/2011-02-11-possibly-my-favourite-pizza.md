Once you start making your own pizza from scratch, it is very difficult to go back to store bought pizza. While takeaway has the wonders of being quick and effortless, they're expensive, generally use low quality ingredients, and are soaked in fat. 

With homemade pizza, providing you don't coat your pizza in a few centimeters of cheese, you don't get the awful aftertaste of takeaway which can leave you feeling rather ill.

**Time**: 1hr5mins (including rising and baking time)  
**Makes**: 2 pizzas  
**Total cost**: ~$5 for two pizzas (factoring in the cost of all ingredients, but in truth you'll probably have salt, flour, yeast, oil and spices laying around anyway)

Ingredients
===========

Pizza base
----------

 - &frac12; teaspoon of salt
 - 2 &frac12; cups of plain flour (I use bakers flour)
 - 2 teaspoons of dried yeast
 - 1 cup of warm water
 - 1 tablespoon of olive oil (plus a little extra for greasing)

Sauce
-----

 - 1 tablespoon of olive oil
 - 400g can of tomatoes - crushed or whole peeled, I prefer whole peeled for extra the flavour
 - 50g (or one sachet) of tomato paste
 - 1 to 2 teaspoons of white sugar
 - a pinch of salt
 - basil to taste
 - thyme to taste

Toppings
--------
 
 - Roma Tomato
 - Salami
 - Ham
 - Jarlsberg (Shaved)
 - Rocket leaves
 - Baby spinach leaves

Process
=======

Pizza dough (40minutes)
--------------------------
The pizza dough can easily be made by hand, or by using a benchtop mixer. I prefer the latter as it ends up being easier and cleaner.

 **1.** Mix the yeast, salt and (sifted) flour together  

 **2.** Slowly mix in the water and the oil  

 **3.** Knead until the dough is smooth and elastic. By hand, this might take 10 minutes - make sure you knead the dough on a floured surface. With a benchtop mixer, using dough hooks, mixer this will take 2-3 minutes on minimum setting.  

 **4.** Place the dough in a greased bowl (for benchtop mixer, pull dough out of the bowl, grease it, put dough back in), cover - with either cling wrap or a teatowel (this is to stop the dough from drying out) - and let the dough stand in a warm place for 30 minutes (roughly, or until the dough as doubled in size)

  **5.** Knead the dough until it is smooth.

  **6.** If you're ready to make the pizzas, halve the dough, then roll out each half into a circle and place on a tray. If you're not ready, wrap the dough up in lightly greased clingwrap and place in a bowl in the fridge - this keeps the dough from rising too much.

Sauce (15minutes - can be done while dough is rising)
----------------------------------------

The sauce is dead easy, but a crucial ingredient. "Cheating" by just using tomato paste on a pizza base just denies the flavour. If you want to save time, you can make up a larger batch of this sauce and either refrigerate or freeze.

My wife suffers from fructose malabsorbtion, meaning she can't have too much (or really any) garlic or onion (as well as a few other things). To add some extra flavour to the sauce, you could crush a clove or two of garlic into the sauce, and/or cook onion in the frypan *before* you start tomato-y parts of the sauce.

**1.** Heat up the olive oil in a frypan  

**2.** Combine all ingredients in the frypan, bring to a boil, then reduce the temperature to a low heat.  

**3.** Simmer, uncovered, to reduce the sauce. This should take 15 minutes or so.

Toppings
---------

So far the pizza base and sauce can be used for just about any pizza - one of my favourite variations on this is a chicken Caesar pizza.   

**1.** Spoon the sauce onto the pizza bases  

**2.** Arrange toppings on pizza - I prefer (from bottom->up): ham, salami, rocket, spinach, tomatoes, cheese.

Ideally you should put the cheese on top, but I was feeling unwell and a little rushed, so I messed that up. We like to use shaved Jarlsberg cheese, which, yes, is more expensive but as its a strong enough cheese, less is used overall.

Supermarkets will have prewashed (or just need a quick rinse) rocket and baby spinach in packets for ~$3 each. These go a *long* way, and using the same toppings in a sandwhich is delicious.

Baking (15 minutes)
----------------------
 **1.** Preheat the oven to 180c (fan-forced, 200c without magic fans)  

 **2.** Bake pizza on trays for 15minutes, uncovered.  

 **3.** Remove pizza, cut it up, revel in the deliciousness you've just created.
