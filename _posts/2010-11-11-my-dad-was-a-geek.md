<p>My father passed away five years ago today, due to some pretty nasty cancer riddling his body. While I have my fair share of regrets, there are far more "shame Dad isn't around to ..." moments going on.</p>
<p>For example, its a huge shame that Dad wasn't around to get to know the girl who would become my wife - he met her, but sadly they never got to know each other. My wife is also a geek, their taste in humour, books and even some music match incredibly well. Speaking of music, it is really only in the last two or three years that I've started to appreciate Tom Waits - one of dads favourites. My father was a big man with a real "lion mane" like beard - its a shame he never got to see the rad sideburns I'm sporting.</p>
<p>But as the title says, my dad was a geek and it is more than likely that I inherited my geekiness from him.</p>
<p><strong><em>It is a shame Dad isn't around to</em></strong> <strong><em>see</em></strong> that our internets speeds - both up and down stream - have increased by an order of magnitude. While in this house we've always been on Optus Cable (as ADSL2 isn't available, and in the early days ADSL wasn't as price competitive), we've gone from 10mbit/128kbit to <strong>100mbit/2mbit</strong><em>. </em></p>

***It is a shame Dad isn't around to see*** affordable, incredibly powerful multi-core/single-proc machines. The price of computers has dropped across the board huge amounts in the last few years - in this house we have ***20*** cores (3x laptops, 2x HTPCs, 1x server, 2x quad core desktops).

At one stage, Dad had an old clunker of a machine - a true Frankenstein pulled from spare parts at work and what we had - which acted as our router (before consumer routers were &lt;$200), powered by Mandrake (<em>before</em> they renamed to Mandriva) and as our general network file server. I remember setting up the IPTables to do the routing, which was a bit of a nightmare given the little experience with Linux I had. It was an incredibly loud machine, with far too many case fans to keep it cool.<br>
These days, I'm letting the Optus provided router do the... well, routing, but my Windows Home Server could easily do the job (it <em>was</em> doing DHCP/Routing on our ADSL connection until we moved a few months ago), and is now sitting where the old clunker used to sit - with just the PSU and a single case fan (no fan on the heatsink), never getting more than 35c, and dual core.<br>
It is these sorts of advances that my Dad would have <em>loved.</em></p>
<p>I just pulled out our old Amiga 2000 HD. Sadly, it appears to have died - the likely culprit being the whopping 40MB SCSI HDD and we no longer have any of the boot disks for it. Dad was a high school teacher, but as a draftsman by trade. At one stage he had an entire <strong><em>lab</em></strong> of Amiga's in the graphics department. For the time, it was simply amazing.</p>

<p>That's a custom switch dad added to switch between Workbench (the OS) v1.3 and v2.0</p>

<p>The monitor is louder than my current desktop. Ouch.</p>

<p>Dual floppy drives <strong><em>and</em></strong> dual mouse input. This was the bomb.</p>
<p><strong><em>It is a shame my Dad isn't around to see </em></strong>affordable, very versatile DSLRs. The wife and I picked up our first DSLR - the EOS 400D - two years ago and only last month picked up a EOS 60D. I always knew that mum and dad had a "fancy old camera", but I never thought much more about it. It turns out it was an Olympus OM-1, one of Olympus' first SLR and a real "classic" design. However, it wasn't until earlier this year when mum pulled out a box of 'random camera stuff' she found that I truly appreciated how much dad loved photography at one point.</p>

<p>I wish I saw half this stuff in action!</p>
<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">*I should clarify, we have moved in with mum to help her clean up/out the house and move in a years time, the wife and I don't have two HTPCs or three laptops</p>
