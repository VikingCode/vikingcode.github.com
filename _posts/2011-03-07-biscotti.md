Biscotti is a delicious traditional italian "twice baked" biscuit. This nice photo was ruined by really crappy quality baking paper that stuck to the biscuits. Normally this isn't an issue but I can't stress how poor the quality of the paper was.

Ingredients
-----------

 - 2 cups of flour
 - 3/4 cup of cornstarch&#8224;
 - 1 &frac12; teaspoons of baking powder
 - 1 teaspoon of salt
 - 1 cup of sugar
 - 3 eggs
 - 3 tablespoons of grated lemon zest?
 - 3/4 cup of coarsely chopped pecans?

&#8224; The original recipe called for *cornmeal*, of which I had none and misread anyway to be cornstarch/flour. End of the day? Doesn't make too much of a difference - the cornmeal will be a lot grittier

? One of the greatest things about biscotti is you can make it whatever flavour you like. Don't like pecans? use almonds (more traditional), or walnuts. Try other citric fruits or go for sweeter flavours like vanilla and cinnamon.

Process
-------

 **1.** Combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder and salt.  

 **2.** In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until they've gone a pale yellow. Then mix in the zest, then the flour mixture and beat until blended.

I'd recommend an electric mixer for this - getting the dough stiff enough that it holds it shape and stands up is important.

 **3.** Stir in the nuts, then let the dough rise for 5 minutes in the bowl.

 **4.** Preheat the oven to 160c (fanforced).  

 **5.** Halve the dough, place onto baking paper/sheets on two separate trays. Wet your hands (you know, with water), then form "logs" out of each of the pieces of dough. By wetting your hands, the dough won't stick.

 **6.** Bake for 35 minutes, cool for 5 minutes. Cut the biscotti diagonally, then place each piece on its side. This is why you'll want *two* trays - there just isn't room otherwise. 

 **7.** Now for the "twice baked" part - put the biscotti back in for a further 15 minutes. If you want rock hard biscotti that *has* to be dunked in coffee to be edible, stick it in for another 25 minutes instead of 15.
