It has been many months since my [original post](http://vikingco.de/woodworkingau.html) on brands/stores in Australia involving woodworking, and since then things have *dramatically* changed in my workshop. I've purchased (and am loving) a new tablesaw (more on that later) and other "minor" tools (compared to that!), have a lot more experience under my belt, etc.

##Aldi
Aldi are an odd, but ultimately interesting store when it comes to tools. Originally I thought the "Taurus" line of tools from Aldi were actually rebadged Einhell, and that isn't entirely untrue - *some* are.

Aldi has a range of OEMs who make products for them as well as handle the warranty, spare parts and repairs. Some things are handled by Einhell, some by Scheppach, and I'm sure there are other brands involved too - probably all with some german roots.

I think the most important thing to note about Aldi tools is that they come with a 60 day, no questions asked money back guarantee. If the tool is no good, return it for a full refund - very little to lose!

###Taurus vs Taurus Titanium
Generally speaking, Taurus is the "blue" range of tools that Aldi sells, and Taurus Titanium is the "red" line of tools. Like many things in life, red is just better. 

The blue range is very much targeted at impulse buy price ranges, and the quality of the tools often reflect that. In many cases this is fine (particular for a general "toolset" for just DIY/repair jobs around the house). 

The titanium series *generally* is of higher quality and the price tag reflects that. They usually also come with a 3 year warranty. [The Taurus Titanium plunge saw](http://vikingco.de/plungesaw.html) they sold late last year is *fantastic* - identical to the saw Scheppach sell for over $100AUD more! Sometimes Aldi have some real gold bargains available. 

##Sawstop
My new tablesaw is a Sawstop, specifically the contractor/1.75hp saw. Yes it was expensive, and there is only one supplier in the country (with some very highly marked up upgrades and accessories for it), but this has made an amazing difference to the quality of my woodworking, general safety, and reduction of anxiety around powertools.

There is controversy over how Sawstop (the company) conduct themselves, but the saw itself is pretty amazing, the assembly instructions are second to none (incredibly clearly written, quality high gloss colour diagrams and colour coded screws and parts) and there is that killer feature, the flesh detecting blade brake. 

##Carbitool
Carbitool are an Australian manufacturer of high end router bits - I have just the one, a very large carbide tipped straight bit. I'll eventually get more as I need them for specific projects, happy with balance of sharpness, quality and price.  Specifically, any carbitool bit is sharper (and will stay sharper) than anything Bunnings sell.

Some of their bits can be sourced cheaply from [Bits Below Cost](http://www.bitsbelowcost.com/index.html), although I'm yet to order from there myself.

##Stores
###Carbatec
I've dealt with Carbatec a few more times and found that their prices and stock levels aren't great. Everything is overpriced (usually cheaper to ship single items from Amazon!), and with no stock indicators on their website you can be waiting anywhere up to 3 months (maybe more, I cancelled that order) before items arrive.

As a rule I'm trying to avoid them now, the markup and delays aren't acceptable. Customer service for things like repairs is pretty great though.

###Hafco
These guys are well priced, good service, quickish turn around.

###[Pop's Shed](http://popsshed.com.au/)
For turning supplies, these guys aren't always the cheapest but I think you'd struggle to find much friendlier. They're the local wood turning supply place, and always happy for a chat.

###[Timberbits](http://timberbits.com/)
Only used them the once, but turn around was very quick and happy with the products.
