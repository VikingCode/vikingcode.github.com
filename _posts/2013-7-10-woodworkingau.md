With the wonders of the internet, we have *so* much information available for non-formal education. Woodworking is no different - there are dozens of very high quality presenters on YouTube helping people like me learn to create sawdust (and other items). One of the issues, however, is that these presenters are, by and large, *Americans*. Is this hatred for America? Not so much, but the availability of tools, materials, and even the use of imperial measurements (over metric) can be confusing at best.

Two great examples are talks of 'big box' stores that carry a range of (furniture grade) timber - walnut, maple, cherry, oak, etc. The equivalent here would be Bunnings who carry pine and oak. Or Masters who carry pine and (red/imported) oak. Or Mitre10 who carry pine and... oak. In America, a "good" entry level tablesaws with cast iron table (Rigid R4512) would set you back about $400-500 depending on vouchers. The cheapest in Australia of equivelent quality is something like the [Carbatec 10" Contractors saw](http://www.carbatec.com.au/carba-tec-10-contractors-saw_c19216) going for nearly double the price.

The point I'm trying to make is that the larger market (just in terms of population, let alone percentage that do woodworking as a hobby) of America compared to Australia makes some of the value/judgement calls very different in these parts of the woods.

I'll try and update this list as I gain more experience with various brands/stores/etc.

##Brands
While I'd prefer to talk about individual tools, it is important to know where some of the brands are positioned in the market.

####Ryobi, AEG, Milwaukee
Techtronics Industries has bought out all three of these brands. As a general rule of thumb, Ryobi is the "hobby/DIY" guy market, Milwaukee is the high end, and AEG falls somewhere in between. It is important to remember the quality AEG *may* have been known for at one stage is no longer relevant for their new items.

As a result, Bunnings stock Ryobi and AEG, but not Milwaukee. Bowens, Dahlsens, and tool specific stores do generally carry them though. 

*Some* AEG products are rebadged RIGID (which appear to be US only) - Techtronics produce many of the RIGID products for Emerson.

####Ozito, Trojan, Craftright
These are all Bunnings "homebrands". While they're not specifically made by Bunnings, they are made for/exclusively sold through Bunnings. As such, they're not high end - they're the budget offering. Ozito covers powertools, Trojan covers handtools and Craftright covers.. some handtools, some measuring tools, but an awkward brand at best.

With that said, *sometimes* they have the right tool for the right job. I have an Ozito biscuit jointer which has a terrible design (clogs easy) but for how often I use the biscuit jointer it was better than paying double the money.

####Taurus, Workzone & Einhell
Taurus is Aldi's power tool homebrand. Like the Bunnings homebrands, sometimes they're great, sometimes they're not. Workzone is the handtools/accessories homebrand.

I *believe* that all the servicing/warranty for Aldi powertools are handled by Einhell, who also have a range of tools. I've had terrible experience with their customer support and parts of the design of their tools. For the price I paid though, I got better than what I should have, so I'm not sure where I stand with them.

####Triton and GMC
A few years back GMC bought out Triton as they were in financial trouble. Triton at the time had few products and were expensive compared to GMCs line up, so GMC positioned them as their high end, and slowly introduced some more profitable items (I guess) under the Triton brand.  Items such as the Triton Jigsaw, Random Orbital Sander and thicknesser seemed to be pretty well regarded from that era. 

Eventually, GMC also went bust and Triton was sold off again. These days I'm not sure who owns them, but many of products introduced during the GMC era are no longer sold. This is both good and bad.

The 'main' items from Triton that you would want are their Workcenter systems, circular saws and routers. The rest of their items are... not their speciality. 

GMC items? I've been told to just avoid.

##Stores
There are some very well setup stores that have served the market for years. Some of these are wonderful and deserve the reputation they've earned. Others, do not, but you may not have much of a choice as often they'll be the sole distributor for the country.

Other than Bunnings, Masters and Mitre10, the 'big' names in woodworking stores seem to be [Carbatec](http://www.carbatec.com.au/) and  [Hare&Forbes](http://www.machineryhouse.com.au/Home) (aka Machinery House aka HafCo). Both of these have an incredible range on hand (either online or instore), that I've mostly dealt with them rather than shopping around.

##Hand Tools
####Chisels
I honestly don't know what separates a good chisel from a bad one - at a guess the quality of the steel & the quality of the handle. Whether it is the greatest chisel of all time or the cheapest, the important thing is to keep them *sharp*. This took me awhile to fully appreciate.

There are very few chisels that are 'ready to go' straight out of the box, they almost all need to be sharpened. 

That being said, I've got a set of 6 Trojan chisels (from Bunnings, $40) that have done me very well and (so long as they're sharp) continue to cut through tassie oak and jarrah very well. To keep them sharp, I've been using the [Stanley 3 Piece Sharpening Set](http://www.bunnings.com.au/products_product_stanley-3-piece-sharpening-set_P5562330.aspx) as it works great for plane blades as well.

####Handsaws
Under the house lives dads old saws - rusted, dulled, and generally abused. Starting out I don't really know how to properly clean the up and sharpen them, so I opted to get myself some japanese saws (from [ToolsFromJapan](http://www.toolsfromjapan.com/)) - specifically a ryoba (double sided), dozuki (similar to a dovetail) and kataba.

For fine joinery, the dozuki is *amazing*. For only needing one saw, the ryoba with rip cut on one side and cross cut on the other is very very useful. The kataba is a good 'general' saw, but of the three is the one I'd happily 'miss out' on.

##Powertools
####Routers
My first router was a Ryobi (avoid, please please avoid), but I've since upgraded to a [Triton JOF001](http://www.tritontools.com/en-US/Model/JOF001) - normally priced at ~$300AUD, I managed to get one for a bargain by buying off ebay. I know what you're thinking, I risked getting a lemon, but it was brand new in box, from a particular seller who happened to be (or still is?) a Triton distributor before the sale to GMC.

I've bought a couple of things from [CheapToolsAU](http://stores.ebay.com.au/cheaptoolsau?_rdc=1) and I'm *very* happy with them - both the tools and the seller.

The JOF001 is the 'lightweight' of the three Triton routers (I want it for both router table and hand held use) but does pack a few nice features (particularly over the cheaper Ryobi)

* Micro adjustment knob for the *full* plunge range
* Large base/fence system - rather than the more traditional fence-on-two-posts, the Triton routers take a base plate that also helps stabilise the router on the work
* Good dust shroud and extraction when hooked up to a shop vac
* Easy to table mount - has a through-the-table-winder built into the kit

##Machinery  
####Tablesaws  
Avoid the [Scheppach HS120](http://www.machineryhouse.com.au/W443). It's rubbish. One of the few tools that I really regret. While the price is 'nice' and the motor is powerful, consider that  

* the blade is rubbish (replace that stat!), 
* the fence is inaccurate and I've had a hard time keeping that flat (!) on the table,
* replacing the fence is difficult as it doesn't have a great surface to bolt something on to,
* the cross cut table/sled is poor,
* there aren't the standard mitre slots for attaching your own jigs

The most annoying part, however, is that here isn't an alternative in that price range. Cast iron contractor style saws start at $900 and cabinet saws at $1200. And then you have the issue of needing a 15 amp socket for *most* of the saws.

####Bandsaws
As mentioned above, I have an Einhell bandsaw (the [RT-SB305](http://www.einhell.com.au/pro_details.php?pid=174) specifically). Originally a bandsaw wasn't on my shopping list because of the prices - anything under $300 has such poor cutting height that they're not worth the hassle. Bandsaws found at Bunnings, for example, have a lousy *80mm* ([Ryobi Bandsaw](http://www.ryobi.com.au/Products/PowerTools/Benchtop/Saws/EBW4023L)) of cutting height. Resawing thinner stock *might* work on it, but forget about even the smallest of branches/blanks for wood turning!

I happened to get the Einhell RT-SB305 for about $250 (normally ~$500), and giving me ~170mm resaw capacity is wonderful for the price.

If you were to pay $500, I would not bother, go for a better brand, there are many design faults with it

* The fence doesn't clamp down firmly (enough vibration and it'll move)
* The included blade couldn't cut through *any* material thicker than 19mm (probably over tightened/dulled in the store, it was a display model)
* Tensioning knob is plastic (on metal) and has a tendency to snap
* Aluminium table (rather than cast iron) isn't very flat due to the 'modular' construction of it. In theory a single aluminium table may be OK.
* Unusual size makes it difficult to find blades for it (Hafco do sell suitable sized blades however).

That being said, once I got a replacement tensioning knob, sharp replacement blades, and ditched the fence, it actually cuts (shapes, straight lines/joints, resawing wet Alder branches and resawing dry/seasoned jarrah) pretty damn well and I'm happy with it (again, for the price).

####Lathes  
Very happy with the Woodfast mini lathe we have, there are compatible Jet mini lathes in the same price range. 

Avoid Einhell, GMC, Rockwell and others that produce a lathe with a solid headstock. Without the morse taper in the headstock, you aren't able to get standard attachments like pen mandrels. The lathes with the solid headstock *tend* to be all very similar designs (I'd imagine the same factory), and are also incredibly noisy too.

##Suppliers
####Glues
For standard wood glue, I've only used [Titebond](http://www.titebond.com.au/) (I/II/III) and I've been very happy with the end result. The cheapest I've managed to find (for  all varieties/sizes) is actually from *[Masters](http://www.masters.com.au/product/900000013/titebond-original-wood-glue-3-7l)*, and yes, they deliver.
