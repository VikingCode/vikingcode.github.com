*Quantum Conundrum* is my "sleeper hit" for 2012, much like *Bastion* was for last year - and I mean that I had heard nothing about it until *bam* in my face awesomeness. First person puzzle game with a funny narrative. Much like *Portal*, which considering [Kim Swift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Swift)'s involvement isn't a surprise - she worked on *Narbacular Drop*, the game that led Valve to hiring the team behind it to work on *Portal*. 

Unlike *Portal*, you don't... use portals. You switch between four dimensions. 

If you can't like jumping or timing puzzles, this probably isn't for you, although there is more to it than that.

Fun, although a bit shorter than I would have liked, and it ended very abruptly. Unfortunately, such a quick ending left me without the sense of accomplishment a good 'ending' can provide. I'm guessing the two upcoming (not sure on dates) DLC and a sequel will 'finish' the game. Regardless, fun, recommended, and currently on sale [on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/200010/?snr=1_7_suggest__13)
