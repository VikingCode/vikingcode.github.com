title: Triton JOF001 and the elusive above-table winder

I've got a [Triton JOF001](http://www.tritontools.com/en-GB/Model/JOF001) router which I'm rather happy with. It's lightweight but still packs a punch, I got it for dirt cheap (new too!), and it includes a height adjustment winder for adjusting the bit height when used in a router table. I've also got the matching router table from Triton, which does *not* include any holes for the height winder! The reasoning, I guess, is because the three routers are different sized - the winder matches up with the TRA001 and MOF001, but the JOF001 is smaller so it doesn't.

I emailed Triton AU (which is actually just the local distributor, Kincrome) about this and got a (very quick/helpful) reply:
	
> We don’t have a drawing but lining the plate up is easy.
	
> Mount the router in the plate as normal. Draw a line around the base of the router with a thin texta or pencil. Make a reference mark on the grey plate in line with a mark on the black plastic router base plate. A blob of Tippex is perfect for this.
	
> Remove the router and take the black plastic base plate off the Router. Now use this to mark the hole to be drilled and align it on the grey mounting plate making sure the mark you made on the grey plate and plastic plate line up.
	
> Centre punch the centre of the hole for the winder handle and drill a 3 or 4 mm hole through the two steel Router plates. Now follow through with a ½ inch or 13mm hole and clean it up with a file. If possible use a drill press with the steel plates firmly clamped down.

I've now done this to my own router/table, so here is the image version of the above advice.

**Unmounted, you can see where the router plate sits**

**Three screws on the bottom plate to remove**

**Bottom plate removed - this is also how you'd install the template guide**

**Realign the bottom plate, the largest circle is where the winder is**

**Measuring the winder handle (as well as the spot to drill marked out and punched)**  
The value is a little hard to read, but its 11.05mm.

**Pilot hole drilled through both plates on the drill press, now for the 12.5mm bit**  
I don't think I've actually drilled through metal before, so if you are like me, don't forget to go as slow as your drill press will let you. Make sure you clamp it down, and wear relevant safety gear (primarily eye protection) because metal filings (aka swarf) is a nasty nasty thing.

**Cleaned up a little with a file**

**And with the winder mounted!**

Big thanks to Gordon Heggie of Kincrome/Triton for the instructions and quick response.
