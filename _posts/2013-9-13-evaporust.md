> Despite appearances, this isn't an ad for products mentioned in this post, it was all bought with my own money in attempts to save money from buying new tools.

My father built one of the houses I lived in as a kid, as well as a whole stack of furniture. Taking up woodworking, I've been lucky in that I've been able to inherit many tools (although not as many as I would have liked, when my father passed many of them went to my uncle). Unfortunately, many of the tools haven't been used in a decade or so, and are now a just a 'little' bit rusted.

I've tried a few acidic/corrosive cleaners (such as [Rustbuster](http://bondall.com/rustbuster/Ranex_Rustbuster.html) which was just useless), but had heard that [Evaporust](http://www.evapo-rust.com.au/) worked well and importantly doesn't require any safety gear. With my chronic headaches, fumes from corrosive cleaners makes me feel awful for days, so I'm happy to report the only smell Evaporust has is slightly citrus-ey.

Unlike corrosive cleaners, this is also *reusable* until the liquid is completely black, which makes it much better value for money!

##The Results
Here are the results, but whats the test? A variety of handtools - some I do use and thought could be cleaner, some that I don't use because of how rusted they are.

###Stanley blockplane

To start with, I didn't want to commit to 5L of Evaporust, so I purchased the 1L bottle. For some of the items this didn't cover all of it (I was doing multiple items at a time), so this plane only got half treated to start with. 

I hadn't really looked, but had just presumed the sides had a brown paint on them (the inside has black paint). After an hour or so the bottom half of rust just wiped away. 

###Tenonsaw
While I have some [japanese saws](/woodworkingau.html), my father had the more traditional western saws, including a tenon saw. It hasn't been used for the best part of 15 years and had rusted to the point of looking not great.

* The top picture is just as it was put into the Evaporust - while not a great photo does show off how much rust there was.
* The middle section is after it was removed from the Evaporust - a much much cleaner blade, but darkened with a lot of carbon left behind from the Evaporust (this is 'normal)
* The final/bottom picture is after hitting the blade with a [Scotch-Brite](http://solutions.3m.com.au/wps/portal/3M/en_AU/APACScotch-BriteBrand/Scotch-Brite/) pad and WD-40.
 
While it took a few hours sitting in the Evaporust, all up it only took about 2 minutes scrubbing a side. 

**At this point, I stopped 'testing'/taking photos.** This technique works very well with minimal effort, so I've attacked the #5 Bailey plane and #151 spokeshave I have. Later on I'll go about restoring some old weapons (kukri and WW2 machete) and making a display case for them.

##Would I buy this again?
Yes. While it isn't *perfect*, for just sitting in a pool of liquid for a few hours, it sure is a heck of a lot better. The important thing to note is that there is no hard work to get it 'mostly clean'.

Further cleaning with sandpaper or/and Scotch-Brite do get most of the tools looking like new, but for many tools that isn't needed (just getting them functional again is enough)

I will also now be buying many rusted hand tools from eBay as I need them, as this is far far cheaper than buying a new Stanely Bailey plane.
